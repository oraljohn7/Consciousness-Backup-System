# Decentralized Consciousness Backup System (DCBS)

## Overview
The Decentralized Consciousness Backup System (DCBS) is a blockchain-based platform designed to facilitate the secure capture, storage, and restoration of human consciousness. The system employs advanced quantum encryption and distributed storage to ensure the integrity and privacy of consciousness data.

## Core Components

### Mind State Capture Contract
Manages the complex process of digitizing and encoding human consciousness.

Key features:
- Neural pattern scanning
- Memory state encoding
- Personality matrix mapping
- Emotional state capture
- Quantum coherence preservation
- Real-time verification
- Error detection and correction

### Storage Contract
Provides secure, distributed storage for consciousness data across the network.

Key features:
- Quantum-encrypted storage
- Multi-dimensional data sharding
- Redundant backups
- Integrity checking
- Temporal versioning
- Auto-healing capabilities
- Storage optimization

### Access Control Contract
Manages the strict permissions and authentication system for consciousness data.

Key features:
- Biometric authentication
- Multi-signature authorization
- Time-locked access
- Emergency protocols
- Legal compliance verification
- Audit logging
- Privacy preservation

### Reintegration Contract
Coordinates the careful process of consciousness restoration.

Key features:
- Neural interface synchronization
- Gradual consciousness transfer
- Memory integrity verification
- Personality consistency checking
- Cognitive function testing
- Emergency rollback capabilities
- Integration monitoring

## Technical Requirements

### Hardware Requirements
- Quantum neural scanners
- High-density storage arrays
- Neural interface units
- Quantum encryption modules
- Backup power systems

### Software Requirements

## Safety and Ethics

### Safety Protocols
- Multiple consciousness verification steps
- Integrity validation at each stage
- Emergency consciousness preservation
- Real-time monitoring
- Automatic failsafes
- Recovery procedures

### Ethical Guidelines
- Informed consent requirements
- Right to deletion
- Privacy protection
- Identity verification
- Non-transferability rules
- Anti-abuse measures

## Usage

### Consciousness Capture
```solidity
function initiateCapture(
    address subject,
    bytes32 consentProof,
    CaptureParameters memory params
) external returns (bytes32 captureId)
```

### Access Management
```solidity
function grantAccess(
    bytes32 consciousnessId,
    address accessor,
    uint256 duration,
    AccessLevel level
) external returns (bool)
```

### Reintegration Process
```solidity
function initiateReintegration(
    bytes32 consciousnessId,
    address newBody,
    bytes32 medicalClearance
) external returns (bytes32 reintegrationId)
```
